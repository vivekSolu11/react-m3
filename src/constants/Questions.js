			'During a project at XYZ Corp, I encountered conflicting priorities when the client requested additional features that were not initially planned. To address this, I scheduled a meeting with the client to understand their requirements and priorities better. After evaluating the impact of the new features on the project timeline and resources, I presented alternative solutions that aligned with the project goals and constraints. Through open communication and negotiation, we reached a consensus that satisfied both the client needs and the project objectives, resulting in a successful project completion.',
